# The Cyber Mine

### What is it?
The Cyber Mine is a place for OreSec members (and eventuall CS students) to practice Cybersecurity and get acquainted with both Red and Blue team toolsets.

We are doing our best to create a fun and interactive learning environment where you'll be able to practice both defending and attacking vulnerable machines in hopes of allowing you to learn about what Cybersecurity really is and some of the more technical aspects of it.

### Who is it for?
Eventually, everyone, currently though it is only open to OreSec members and access is provisioned through the discord. We are doing this as we are still testing and developing much of the Cyber Mine and are slowly making it better and better. We hope that if this is something you're interested in, you'll join us in working on it!

### How to get involved?
Message in the Discord and attend any meetings relating to the Cyber Range! If you have specific ideas, message Garrett or one of the other officers.
