# __Beginner Resources__
Here are some beginner resources for those interested! Shoot us a message or any of the other officers if you have questions in Discord! We are not all knowing, but most if not all are willing to help!

## __Websites__
[__picoGYM__](https://play.picoctf.org/practice)
- This is a great place to start as it will allow you to learn skills needed to compete in Capture the Flag competitions as well as build important basic skills like using a shell, examining files, decoding, and identifying things that are out of the norm. This is a great way to start your cybersecurity journey and there are tons of online resources related to solving these. In the future we plan to offer our own write-up of a ton of the challenges so that you can follow along with it.
- Tips: Google is your friend as there are tons of solutions to the challenges online.

[__overthewire__](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
- If you want to take a deep dive into the shell and learn all about it this is the place. Overthewire provides challenging tasks that will test your knowledge of Shell functionality and how to apply it to CTF challenges or other tasks you may find in the world of Cybersecurity.
- Tips: I recommend setting up a Virtual Machine in order to begin using a shell on your personal machine. While powershell is cool, BASH is cooler.

[__TryHackMe__](https://tryhackme.com/)
- TryHackMe is probably the best if you want a bit more guidance and structure when beginning to learn penetration testing. Not everyone is able to learn without structure and that’s what this site aims to provide. They have rooms and machines for you to learn specific topics and techniques for penetration testing and system hardening. Some machines and rooms will require a subscription, so if you’re trying to stay free maybe stay away from it. I did buy it at one point to see what it was like and it’s definitely worth it for what you get, however you can still learn the material without using this site.
- Tips: Check it out first and decide if you want structure while learning or if you think free resources will be more advantageous to you.

[__HackTheBox__](https://app.hackthebox.com/home)
- Want a challenge? This is the place. HackTheBox contains probably some of the most challenging PWN tasks on the internet that will test everything you know about cyber. Expect to perform full blown penetration tests for the most part on any box you attempt on the website. This is definitely not the best place to start your journey, but will certainly force you to learn!
- Tips: Google is your friend. Don’t feel bad about using write-ups, there are always new boxes. Enumerate, Enumerate, Enumerate(If you don’t know what this is, that’s where to start).
Head over to #htb-request to input your HTB username so that we can accept you into the university in hackthebox!

[__Cryptopals__](https://cryptopals.com/)
- If you feel like you are struggling with cryptography concepts this is an awesome place to test your knowledge and learn new things about the topic. Cryptography can get very advanced especially when you start looking into the bleeding edge of quantum cryptography and those topics are starting to appear in CTF challenges so I definitely recommend understanding the basics and some of the more advanced Cryptography techniques and the inner workings of them.
- Tips: RFC’s (Request for Comments) help a ton when trying to learn older topics as they are normally documented well within them. Specifically with things like Cryptography and the IP/TCP stack protocols.

[__Google__](https://google.com)
- Easily the best and most important tool to learn things. There is so much information out there about Cybersecurity and chances are when you run into something you don’t know immediately there is documentation somewhere. Being able to Google well is a key skill in this field.
- Tips: Reword your questions about challenges to be about a specific topic rather than just googling the challenge.

## __Recommended CyberSecurity Linux Distributions__
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/)
- [ParrotOS](https://www.parrotsec.org/)
- An OS is just a tool, it does not make the security engineer


## __Youtube Channels__
- [Liveoverflow](https://www.youtube.com/c/LiveOverflow) - One of the best ways to start learning Binary Exploitation and Reverse Engineering.

- [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnHammond010) - Walk-throughs of challenges as well as good videos on how to build intuition as to what challenges want you to do.
