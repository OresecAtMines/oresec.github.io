# __High School CTF__

This is a new tradition that we are starting here at OreSec. We will be running a High School CTF annualy in the Spring semester form here on out with challenges crafter by OreSec members for local Colorado high schools in-person and eventually virtually across the nation.

If you are interested in participating in volunteer work, problem creation, or just want to learn more about our process watch for message in the discord about it!
